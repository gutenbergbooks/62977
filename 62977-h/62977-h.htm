<p>The <a href="#cover">Front Cover</a>:</p>
<p>The New York Central Memorial, or Peace Monument, Point Park,
Lookout Mountain, Tennessee. This is the largest and most imposing
monumental structure in the park. The height is 95 feet. The base is
50 feet in diameter. The platform is reached by 7 steps which are
made of Tennessee marble. There is a colonnade 3 steps above the
platform. In the center of the colonnade is a pedestal on which rests
the tall circular shaft. The shaft is surmounted by bronze figures of a
Union and Confederate soldier with &ldquo;Old Glory&rdquo; towering above them.
&ldquo;Their hands once raised in strife, now clasping a brother&rsquo;s hand.&rdquo;
These bronze figures are 8&prime; 9&Prime; high and were designed by R. Hinton
Perry of New York, to whom the idea was suggested by General
Daniel E. Sickles. The pink granite in this monument came from
Milford, Mass. The contractor for the granite work was G. H. Cutting
Granite Co., of Worcester, Mass. The plans and specifications for the
monument were prepared by A. J. Zabriskie, Engineer and Secretary
of the New York Monument Commission. This monument was erected
in 1907 at a cost of approximately $80,000.00. It was dedicated on
November 15, 1910, with impressive ceremonies, the dedication alone
costing $21,138.58. In his address on that occasion General Sickles
said of this monument:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I take a great deal of pride in that monument. It was designed
by my colleagues and myself and my secretary, A. J. Zabriskie. I
myself designed a great deal of the statuary which surmounts it. It
represents conciliation; and that was my thought&mdash;my thought of a
Northern and Southern soldier standing under one flag, which they
both hold as they embrace each other. That is the spirit in which we
have done our monumental work in Chattanooga, in placing there an
enduring monument to reconciliation and peace. New York holds out
her hand to Tennessee. New York embraces Tennessee and all her
sister states in the South. New York offers to all of them good fellowship,
good will and reconciliation now and forever.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="c1"><span class="small">CHICKAMAUGA AND CHATTANOOGA NATIONAL MILITARY PARK</span>
<br />(Georgia and Tennessee)</h2>
<p>By an act of Congress, approved August 19, 1890, the Chickamauga
and Chattanooga National Military Park was established, with
a view to preserving and suitably marking those battlefields for historical
and professional military study. The part undertaken by the
Government in the establishment of this park embraced the purchase
of lands, restoration of the fields, construction of roads and trails,
building of observation towers, the erection of appropriate monuments
to the regular troops engaged there, the preparation of hundreds
of historical tablets for the various organizations of the contending
armies, the mounting of original guns in their exact positions
during the battles and the erection of shell pyramids, both of square-base
and triangular-base type.</p>
<p>The park was created as a result of the reunion of the Army of
the Cumberland which was held in Chattanooga, Tennessee, on
September 19-20, 1889. At this reunion, the Chickamauga Memorial
Association was formed. Gen. John T. Wilder was elected president
and Gen. Joseph Wheeler vice-president. Then a Board of Directors,
numbering 28, were elected. Of this number, an equal division was
made of ex-Union and ex-Confederate officers.</p>
<p>Since that time the various states having troops in the battles
have erected hundreds of beautiful, expensive monuments and markers
which show the exact regimental positions of their troops. The
tablets mark the brigade and division positions and give a brief history
of their activities. The blue tablets mark the Union positions,
while the red tablets mark Confederate positions. Another interesting
thing to know is that all of these tablets have been placed in such
a manner that when you are facing them, you are facing the same
direction which the troops were facing at that time and place. Therefore,
if anyone cares to follow up the movements of any particular
organization, it can be done very easily.</p>
<p>Every effort has been made to restore the battlefields to their
original condition. Speaking of the shell pyramids, there are 14 of
the square-base type which mark the headquarters sites of either an
army corps or the field headquarters of the commanding general.
There are 8 of the triangular-base pyramids which mark the exact
spot where each of the brigade commanders lost their lives. All of
these are located on the Chickamauga battlefield. On Missionary
Ridge, a bronze cannon-ball monument has been substituted for a
pyramid. This also marks the site where a brigade commander lost
his life. One original house stands on the Chickamauga battlefield;
also three replicas of the original.</p>
<p>This is the largest and oldest of the National Military Parks. It
is probably the first one on which the high-ranking officers of the
contending armies ever met to determine their exact locations during
the battles. The park consists of approximately 8,584 acres, and
embraces the battlefields of Chickamauga, Orchard Knob, Lookout
Mountain and Missionary Ridge, all of which were very important in
military operations around Chattanooga, Tennessee, in the fall of
1863. The Chickamauga battlefield alone covers 5,562 acres.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="small">CHATTANOOGA AND ITS IMPORTANCE DURING THE CIVIL WAR</span></h2>
<p>In 1863 Chattanooga was a very small town with a population
of only 4,000. Notwithstanding the small population, it was the objective
of both the Union and Confederate armies. Its importance
was chiefly due to the railroads that intersected here. There were
rail connections to the Mississippi River at Memphis; to the Ohio
River via Nashville and Louisville; to the Atlantic at Savannah and
Charleston via Atlanta, and to Richmond via Knoxville and Lynchburg.
In addition to this, Chattanooga was located on the Tennessee
River. Therefore, with every transportation facility possible, its
possession was of vital importance. Union troops in possession of
Chattanooga, meant a wedge through the Confederacy, because Chattanooga
was the &ldquo;key&rdquo; to east Tennessee and northwest Georgia.
Furthermore, it would discourage the forwarding of supplies and the
transportation of troops back and forth from Richmond to the areas
in west Tennessee and Mississippi. The section of east Tennessee in
which Chattanooga is located is one of the most fertile sections in the
entire South for the production of grain. Not only wheat, corn and
hay, but plenty of beef, bacon, horses and mules. All of these were
of vital importance in the support of an army. In fact, both Governments
profited from the resources of this area.</p>
<p>Another reason for Chattanooga&rsquo;s importance was a political
reason. All of the mountainous region of east Tennessee in which
Chattanooga is located was exceptionally sympathetic with the
Union. President Lincoln and his military advisers regarded the
possession of Chattanooga by the Union army as second only in importance
to the capture of Richmond&mdash;the Confederate capital. It
was by far the most important city in Tennessee to place Union
forces since it would encourage the Unionist sentiment and relieve
the loyal citizens from Confederate control.</p>
<p>Eventually two major battles were fought for possession of
Chattanooga. First, the battle of Chickamauga on September 19-20,
which was a Confederate victory. Two months later the battle of
Chattanooga was fought. This was a three-day battle. At Orchard
Knob, Nov. 23rd; Lookout Mountain, Nov. 24th; Missionary Ridge,
Nov. 25th. This was a very decisive victory for the Union army.</p>
<p>NOTE: In reading of the battles, please remember that any
name used applies strictly to their commands unless otherwise explained.</p>
<h3>THE FIRST OCCUPATION OF CHATTANOOGA BY CONFEDERATES</h3>
<p>At the outbreak of the Civil War, there were no Confederate
soldiers in Chattanooga. They made their appearance in the spring
of 1862&mdash;a year after the war started. These troops were commanded
by Generals Floyd, Maxey and Leadbetter. It was only a
short time until Union forces, commanded by General Mitchell, arrived.
They shelled the city on June 7th and 8th, and the Confederates
made a hasty exit. In August, General Braxton Bragg, commanding
the Confederate army, invaded Chattanooga and started a
campaign into Kentucky. After an unsuccessful campaign in Kentucky,
Bragg was forced to fall back to Murfreesboro, Tennessee. At
this time the Union army was at Nashville, Tennessee. On December
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
31, 1862, and January 1-2, 1863, the battle of Stones River, or
Murfreesboro, was fought. This was a fierce battle which resulted
in a Union victory. The victory enabled the Union army to spend
the remainder of the winter in Murfreesboro, while the Confederates
retreated southeastward to Tullahoma, Tennessee. At this time the
Army of the Cumberland (Union) was commanded by Major-General
William S. Rosecrans. The Army of Tennessee (Confederate) was
commanded by General Braxton Bragg whom Fort Bragg, one of our
most modern army posts, is named in honor of. Both armies were
making preparations for future battles which they realized were forthcoming
once winter was over. The Confederates posted a strong line
of cavalry on the north side of the Duck river. Their infantry positions
were strongly fortified. The winter months were long and
severe, and you may be sure that both armies endured many hardships.
The Union plans called for Rosecrans to take Chattanooga
and Atlanta, both important railroad centers, during 1863. In fact,
Chattanooga was an important railroad center as early as 1850. Both
armies were rather idle for several months although Rosecrans was
being urged to renew hostilities against Bragg.</p>
<h3>THE TULLAHOMA CAMPAIGN</h3>
<p>Finally, on June 23, 1863, Rosecrans left Murfreesboro, moving
against Bragg at Tullahoma. By exercising very clever strategy in
the form of a series of flanking movements, the Confederates were
forced to give up one stronghold after another. The Confederates
finally crossed the Tennessee River at Bridgeport and Caperton&rsquo;s
Ferry, Alabama, and moved directly into Chattanooga. The first
arrival at Chattanooga was at the same hour that General Pickett
made his famous charge at Gettysburg, namely near high noon on
July 3rd. By this time the Union army had advanced to the western
base of the Cumberland Mountain. The right of their line was at
Winchester; the left at McMinnville. Rosecrans, with his headquarters
at Winchester, was making preparations for another campaign
for occupying Chattanooga. At this time Chattanooga was of utmost
importance to both armies, and no doubt the largest prize from a
military standpoint which the Army of the Cumberland ever contended
for. The Confederates had destroyed the bridge across the
Tennessee River at Bridgeport to delay the pursuit of the Union
Army. The Union army consisted of three regular Army Corps; the
14th, commanded by Maj.-Gen. George H. Thomas; the 20th, commanded
by Maj.-Gen. Alexander McCook, and the 21st, commanded
by Maj.-Gen. Thomas L. Crittenden. The Cavalry Corps was commanded
by Brig.-Gen. Robert Mitchell; the Reserve Corps was commanded
by Maj.-Gen. Gordon Granger. The disposition of the Union
forces was as follows:</p>
<p>Thomas was posted at Decherd; McCook at McMinnville, and
Crittenden at Winchester. Again Rosecrans was urged to renew
hostilities against Bragg. The Cumberland, Raccoon and Lookout
Mountain ranges and the Tennessee River were some of the giant
obstacles between Rosecrans and Chattanooga. To cross these required
a maximum of time and supplies as it was quite a task. There
were railroads to repair; the river bridge to be rebuilt. All of this
required time and labor. It was humanly impossible for Rosecrans
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
to begin a forward movement at this time. By extending every
effort possible, it was July 25th before the railroads were repaired.
Another weighty consideration of Rosecrans was the necessary forage
for the animals. Having knowledge that corn would not be ripe
in east Tennessee and northern Alabama before the middle of August,
Rosecrans insisted on waiting until that time before he launched another
campaign. Officials of the War Department were eager for
action on the part of Rosecrans.</p>
<p>On August 4th, Gen. Halleck sent a message to Rosecrans which
said: &ldquo;Your forces must move forward without delay. You will
daily report the movement of each corps till you cross the Tennessee
River.&rdquo; Since Rosecrans was not ready for the movement, he replied:
&ldquo;Your dispatch ordering me to move forward without delay, reporting
the movements of each corps till I cross the Tennessee River
received. As I have determined to cross the river as soon as practicable,
and have been making all preparations and getting such information
as may enable me to do so without being driven back, like
Hooker, I wish to know if your order is intended to take away
my discretion as to the time and manner of moving my troops.&rdquo;
To this message Gen. Halleck replied: &ldquo;The orders for the advance
of your army, and that it be reported daily are peremptory.&rdquo; This
latter message did not set well with Rosecrans. He prepared his
reply and after conferring with his corps commanders and receiving
their assurance that they would support him, he sent the following
message: Gen. Halleck: &ldquo;My arrangements for beginning a continuous
movement will be completed and the execution begun Monday
next. We have information to show that crossing the Tennessee
River between Bridgeport and Chattanooga is impracticable, but not
enough to show whether we had better cross above Chattanooga and
strike Cleveland, or below Bridgeport and strike in their rear. The
preliminary movement of troops for the two cases are quite different.
It is necessary to have our means of crossing the river completed and
our supplies provided to cross 60 miles of mountains and sustain
ourselves during the operations of crossing and fighting, before we
move. To obey your order literally would be to push our troops into
the mountains on narrow and difficult roads, destitute of pasture
and forage; and short of water where they would not be able to
maneuver as exigencies demand, and would certainly cause ultimate
delay and probable disaster. If, therefore, the movement which I
propose can not be regarded as obedience to your order, I respectfully
request a modification of it or to be relieved from the command.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Gen. Halleck wired him as follows: &ldquo;I have communicated
to you the wishes of the Government in plain and unequivocal
terms. The objective has been stated, and you have been directed
to lose no time in reaching it. The means you are to employ
and the roads you are to follow are left to your own discretion.
If you wish to promptly carry out the wishes of the Government
you will not stop to discuss mere details. In such matters I do
not interfere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rosecrans replied the same day. His message read: &ldquo;Your
dispatch received. I can only repeat the assurance given before
the issuance of the order. This army shall move with all dispatch
compatible with the successful execution of our work. We
are pressing everything to bring up forage for our animals. The
present rolling stock of the road will barely suffice to keep us
day by day here, but I have bought 50 more freight cars, which
are arriving. Will advise you daily.&rdquo; There was no further interference
from Washington.</p>

<h2 id="c3"><span class="small">THE CAMPAIGN FOR CHATTANOOGA</span></h2>
<p>On August 16th, the Union army started their forward movement.
Thomas and McCook moved their corps down to the Tennessee River
at Bridgeport. Crittenden moved down the Sequatchie Valley, having
troops from just north of Jasper to a point above Pikeville. A
part of the latter&rsquo;s corps, (Wilder&rsquo;s and Wagner&rsquo;s Mounted Infantry)
took positions along Walden&rsquo;s Ridge and Signal Mountain where they
were in plain view of the Confederates in Chattanooga. Numerous
demonstrations were made at these points to attract the attention of
the Confederates and to make them believe they were attempting to
cross the river at some point above the city. They would beat on
empty barrels to imitate the rolling of supply wagons. They also
built huge bon-fires and would march back and forth in the flare of
them. Buglers were placed at distant points where they would strike
a few notes at regular intervals. They even sawed planks, boards
and pieces of logs to float down the river to give the Confederates
the impression they were building a pontoon bridge at some point
above the city. On August 21st, a part of Wilder&rsquo;s brigade advanced
to Stringer&rsquo;s Ridge where they shelled Chattanooga with artillery.
One shell landed in front of the First Presbyterian Church at Seventh
and Market streets, while services were being conducted. Some reports
claim that a little girl had her leg broken by a piece of shell.
However, according to the report of Confederate Gen. D. H. Hill, several
women and children were killed. Today, Chattanooga&rsquo;s tallest building,
the Hamilton National Bank, stands on this site. The shelling
of the city showed that the Union troops were on the immediate front
of the Confederates. As a result, Cleburne&rsquo;s division was sent to
Harrison, and then distributed at every ford and ferry between the
mouths of the Chickamauga Creek and the Hiwasee River&mdash;a distance
of at least 50 miles. These troops were so placed in order to
guard against any possible crossing by the Union troops. All of these
positions were covered by rifle-pits and batteries. With the Confederates&rsquo;
attention drawn in this direction, the main body of the Union
army effected a crossing of the river at Bridgeport, 30 miles below
Chattanooga, between August 29th and September 4th, unmolested.
Thomas crossed over the Sand Mountain to Trenton, Georgia, after
much difficulty.</p>
<p>When Bragg learned that the Union army had crossed the river
below him he evacuated Chattanooga during the 8th and 9th of
September, moving 26 miles southward to LaFayette, Georgia, behind
the Pigeon Mountains. This movement was made in order that
he could protect his line of communications and his base of supplies,
his base being Atlanta. As the last of Bragg&rsquo;s army was leaving the
city on the morning of September 9th, the 92nd Illinois Mounted
Infantry made a reconnaissance on Lookout Mountain. They then
entered the city. Crittenden&rsquo;s corps followed the railroad to Ringgold,
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
then westward to Rock Springs in pursuit of the Confederates.
At this latter point, Crittenden was directly between Bragg and
Chattanooga.</p>
<h3>PRELIMINARY MOVEMENTS</h3>
<p>Rosecrans was led to believe that Bragg was in full retreat to
Rome and Atlanta. He had gathered this information from pretended
deserters from the Confederate army. However, he was determined
to head the Confederates off. He immediately dispatched
Thomas and McCook down Lookout Valley to point 26 and 42 miles
below Chattanooga where they crossed Lookout Mountain. Thomas
moved into McLemore&rsquo;s Cove; McCook to Alpine and Summerville,
Georgia. In planning these movements and making such disposition
of his troops, Rosecrans was falling into a trap which had been set
for him. Bragg&rsquo;s army was not in retreat. They had no intentions
of retreating. Rosecrans was not aware of the fact that Bragg was
not in retreat until about September 12th. His army was divided
into three sections. It was at least 60 miles from the left to right of
his troops. Meanwhile, Bragg at LaFayette, was opposite the Union
center and in position to attack and crush the Union army in detail
as they emerged from the mountains. He had already been re-enforced
by Buckner from east Tennessee and Walker from Mississippi.
He was only awaiting Longstreet&rsquo;s arrival from Virginia before turning
back in an effort to retake Chattanooga. The latter named troops
were seasoned veterans who were sent down by Gen. Lee. A great
many of them had fought in the battle of Gettysburg. Upon their
arrival Bragg ordered the Confederates to turn back toward Chattanooga.
His plan was to attack Crittenden and in case Thomas and
McCook should arrive they could be taken care of, likewise, in order.
Failure of his subordinate officers to comply promptly with these
orders caused this opportunity to be lost. Rosecrans, upon learning
that Bragg had received heavy re-enforcements and was turning back
in an effort to retake Chattanooga, hurriedly ordered the concentration
of his forces. McCook, contrary to orders, took a roundabout
route from Summerville, causing some delay. However, on September
17th, he joined Thomas and they in turn started their movement
to join Crittenden. At this time Crittenden was on the west side of
Chickamauga Creek at Lee and Gordon&rsquo;s Mill. It was necessary for
Thomas and McCook to make a forced march day and night in order
to reach Crittenden. They were practically exhausted when they
reached him.</p>
<h3>BRAGG&rsquo;S PLAN FOR BATTLE</h3>
<p>On September 17th, Bragg had ordered his troops to cross the
Chickamauga Creek at Reed&rsquo;s and Alexander&rsquo;s bridges. They were
to sweep up the creek toward Crittenden&rsquo;s position. His objective
was to gain possession of the main road between Rosecrans and
Chattanooga. Incidentally, this main road is known today as Highway
U. S. No. 27. The Confederates reached Chickamauga Creek on
Friday afternoon, September 18th. Here they met with some opposition
from the Union troops. After a great deal of skirmishing, of
which some was rather severe, the Confederates effected a crossing.</p>
<h3>THE BATTLE OF CHICKAMAUGA</h3>
<p>On Saturday morning the right of the Confederate line extended
to the Reed&rsquo;s Bridge road. Forrest&rsquo;s Cavalry Corps was posted on
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
the right of this line. Thomas&rsquo; troops arrived on the LaFayette road
at the Kelley field near daylight on Saturday morning, the 19th.
Brannan&rsquo;s division moved up the main road to the McDonald field,
thence east toward Reed&rsquo;s bridge. When in the vicinity of Jay&rsquo;s Mill
they encountered Forrest&rsquo;s cavalry. Croxton&rsquo;s brigade fired into
them and thus opened the battle of Chickamauga. Forrest&rsquo;s men
dismounted and returned the fire, fighting as infantry. It was now
7:30 A. M. The battle was slow to start. Then it became severe.
Both sides sent for re-enforcements which were sent at once. Connell&rsquo;s
and VanDerveer&rsquo;s brigades came to Croxton&rsquo;s support while
Walker and Liddell brought their divisions to Forrest&rsquo;s assistance.
Due to the Confederates not being in the positions which Bragg had
ordered them, a great deal of confusion resulted. However, troops
kept filling in on both sides until the lines were about three miles in
length. Each side gained and lost ground many times by severe
charging and counter-charging. Baird made an effort to reform his
lines but while doing so, was attacked by Walker in greater numbers.
King and Scribner were driven back some distance at the same time.
The Union forces then drove Walker to his former position. At this
time Cheatham came to Walker&rsquo;s rescue and they drove Johnson,
Palmer and VanCleve back in order. Reynolds was then overpowered
by the Confederates, the rebels yelling wildly all the while. Davis
and Wood then checked the advance of the Confederates. After adjusting
their lines, they drove Cheatham, Walker and Stewart back
to their former positions. Most of the fighting was in the woods at
this time although some was in open fields. Much of it was at very
close range. In just such manner the fighting lasted all the forenoon,
neither side gaining very much. Casualties were high on both sides.
It is believed that the 10th and 74th Indiana Infantry were the most
severely engaged at this time. It may be interesting to learn that
Col. William B. Carroll, commanding the 10th Indiana Infantry, was
the first field officer to be killed at Chickamauga. By noon the fighting
was general throughout the lines.</p>
<p>During the afternoon the most severe fighting took place near
the opposite ends of the lines in the Vineyard field. Fighting at this
point was all at close range and some was hand-to-hand. About 4:00
P. M., Col. Hans C. Heg, 15th Wisconsin Infantry, was mortally
wounded. Col. Heg commanded the 3rd brigade of Davis&rsquo; division.
With death staring him in the face, he again rallied his men and rode
nearly one-quarter of a mile before the loss of blood weakened him to
such an extent that he was forced to give up his command. His
brigade was taken over by Col. John A. Martin of the 8th Kansas
Infantry. Col. Heg was the first brigade commander to fall on the
Chickamauga battlefield. After a restless night in a hospital, he
passed away near noon of the 20th. After sundown the fighting
ceased at all portions of the field. Neither side had gained any worthwhile
advantage during this first day of battle, although the Union
forces had been driven much closer to the main road. The left of the
Union line under Thomas was well anchored across the main highway;
the center under McCook was just west of the highway, and
the right end of the line under Crittenden was still east of the highway.
The Confederate line was very close to the Union line at all
points. Shortly after dark the battle was renewed near the north
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
end of the lines. Cleburne and Cheatham encountered Johnson and
Baird. The fighting lasted only about an hour but the losses were
heavy. Two brigade commanders lost their lives about 7:00 P. M. On
the Union side, Col. Philemon P. Baldwin of Indiana, was killed. Col.
Baldwin commanded the 3rd brigade of Johnson&rsquo;s division. Col.
William W. Berry of the 5th Kentucky Infantry, assumed command
of Baldwin&rsquo;s brigade. On the Confederate side, Brig.-Gen. Preston
Smith of Tennessee was killed. Gen. Smith commanded a brigade of
Cheatham&rsquo;s division. Col. Alfred J. Vaughn, Jr., 13th Tennessee
Infantry, assumed command of Smith&rsquo;s brigade. During the night
both armies rearranged their lines in preparation for the next day&rsquo;s
battle. The right end of the Union line was shifted from the vicinity
of the Vineyard field westward to the Crawfish Springs road near
Widow Glenn&rsquo;s. The Confederate line remained east of the highway
at all points, slightly over-lapping the Union line on either end. The
troops on the left of the Union line fortified their positions during
the night by falling trees, stacking rails, stumps, etc., in preparation
for Sunday&rsquo;s battle. On the Confederate side Longstreet, the South
Carolinian, arrived with his corps about 11:00 P. M. At this time
Bragg divided his army into two wings, the left and right. Longstreet
was given command of the left wing; Gen. Leonidas Polk, the
North Carolinian, who was the first Protestant Episcopal Bishop of
Louisiana, was placed in command of the right wing. Bragg gave
order for the battle to be resumed at daylight on Sunday morning.
His plan was to launch the Confederate right against the Union left,
with each division and brigade to their left to take up the firing in
order until the battle became general throughout the field. Hill&rsquo;s
corps was on the right of the Confederate line. Breckinridge commanded
the extreme right division. The latter had three brigades,
commanded by Helm, Adams and Stovall.</p>
<p>Sunday morning came. The battle was not resumed at daylight.
Sunrise came, but still no battle. Bragg was waiting impatiently,
listening and wondering. His orders were not being carried out, even
in part. Finally, becoming nervous, he went in search of Polk, Hill
and Breckinridge. He was determined to find the cause for delay. It
seems that everyone but the right one had received their orders.
Hill claimed he had no knowledge of Bragg&rsquo;s plan, although his division
commanders had received their orders. Some of the Confederates
had not had their breakfast, although it was considerably past
the breakfast hour. None of the troops were in position for battle
as had been ordered. This necessitated a great deal of rearrangement
in the lines. It is a known fact that Hill did not approve of
Polk being in a higher command than himself. Hill insisted that he
was senior to Polk in his rank. Possibly this caused the delay in resuming
the battle. About 9:00 o&rsquo;clock, the Confederate right was
thrown forward against the Union left. The logworks were too
strong for the Confederates. Time and again they charged, to be
driven back with severe losses. This fighting was at very close range.
Helm&rsquo;s brigade was almost shattered, and while engaged in this desperate
struggle, the commander, Brig.-Gen. Ben Hardin Helm of
Kentucky was mortally wounded. Helm was a brother-in-law of
President Lincoln&rsquo;s wife. However, fragments of his brigade, in
addition to Adams and Stovall, gained the left and rear of the Union
left and entered the Kelley field. Later they were repulsed. Gradually
the battle rolled from right to left along the Confederate line.
Longstreet, near the Confederate center, was opposite the Brotherton
house. About 11:15 A. M., a gap was created in the Union center
when Wood&rsquo;s division, through the misunderstanding of an order
issued by Rosecrans, withdrew from the line and marched to the left
and rear of Brannan.</p>

throwing the right and right center of the Union line back in confusion.
Rosecrans, McCook and Crittenden left the field. A great
many of the troops under the latter named two left the field. Some
few of them later rallied and remained on the field during the afternoon.
Gen. Thomas, then being the senior officer on the field, immediately
assumed command. Holding a pivot with the extreme left of
his line, the right end moved back until it reached Snodgrass hill.
This gave him an almost impregnable position. With this newly
formed east-west line he could check the advance of the Confederates
and also cover Rosecrans&rsquo; retreat. The Confederates, upon crossing
the road, changed front with their artillery. Their infantry swept
around like a large gate on hinges. By almost continuous advancing,
the Confederates reached the south side of Snodgrass hill where they
established their line. Within less than an hour from the time of the
break in the Union line, three other brigade commanders lost their
lives. Near the Confederate right, Col. Peyton H. Colquitt, 46th
Georgia Infantry, was mortally wounded about noon. Colquitt commanded
Gist&rsquo;s brigade of Walker&rsquo;s division. Lt.-Col. Leroy Napier
assumed command of Colquitt&rsquo;s brigade. A short distance to the
south, Brig.-Gen. James Deshler of Texas was killed about the same
time. Deshler commanded a brigade in Cleburne&rsquo;s division. His
command was taken over by Col. Roger Q. Mills. Farther to the
southwest in the Union line, Brig.-Gen. William H. Lytle, the Cincinnati
soldier-poet, was killed while trying to rally his brigade
against the Confederate sweep to the north. Lytle commanded the
1st brigade of Sheridan&rsquo;s division. His command was taken over by
Col. Silas Miller of the 36th Illinois Infantry.</p>
<h3>THE PEAK OF THE BATTLE</h3>
<p>By 2:00 P. M. the battle was raging on Snodgrass hill. This
fighting was at very close range and a great deal was hand-to-hand
struggling. The Confederates kept charging up the slopes, making
every effort to drive the Union troops from their position. They
were never able to carry the hill. A few of the Confederates passed
over the hill to the right of the Union line. They moved to the rear
of Brannan and entered the valley beyond his position. About 3.00
P. M., when the fighting reached its peak, Longstreet sent to Bragg
for re-enforcements from the right wing. However, he never received
them. On the contrary, he was told by Bragg that the troops
of the right wing had been beaten back so badly that they would be
of no service to him. There were Confederates in reserve which had
scarcely been engaged, if Longstreet could only have gotten them.
Along the Union line, it was quite different. At 3:30 P. M., Steedman&rsquo;s
division of Granger&rsquo;s reserve corps came to Thomas&rsquo;s assistance.
These re-enforcements consisted of Mitchell&rsquo;s and Whitaker&rsquo;s
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
brigades. They drove the Confederates from the rear of Brannan,
strengthened and prolonged the Union line westward. They also
passed out ammunition along the line. While the fighting was so
severe the woods caught on fire. This was caused by the artillery
firing so low. Hundreds of the soldiers, both Union and Confederate,
were burned and scorched beyond recognition. Steedman no doubt
saved Thomas from having to retreat from the hill since the latter&rsquo;s
ammunition supply was completely exhausted. It was at this point
that Thomas gained the name of &ldquo;The Rock of Chickamauga.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>THE CLOSE OF THE BATTLE</h3>
<p>At 4:45 P. M., Thomas received orders from Rosecrans directing
him to withdraw. The withdrawal was not started at this time.
There had been severe fighting in the Kelley field during the afternoon.
At 5:00 P. M. Col. Edward A. King, 68th Indiana Infantry,
was killed in the southeast corner of this field. King commanded
the 2nd brigade of Reynolds division. He was the last of the eight
brigade commanders who lost their lives on the Chickamauga battlefield.
Col. Milton S. Robinson assumed command of his brigade.
About 7:00 P. M., Thomas began to withdraw. The Confederates
had gained possession of the LaFayette road to the left and rear of
the Union line. Since Thomas wanted to re-establish his lines between
Bragg and Chattanooga, the withdrawal was made via McFarland
Gap to Rossville; then south on the Chattanooga-LaFayette
highway to Rossville Gap and Missionary Ridge. Fortifications
were thrown up along this portion of the ridge to keep the Confederates
in check. The Union line also extended across Chattanooga
Valley and up the slopes of Lookout Mountain. Thomas held this
line along Missionary Ridge throughout Monday, the 21st. During
the night they abandoned this position and moved into Chattanooga.
Thus ended the battle of Chickamauga.</p>
<p>There were approximately 124,000 troops engaged at Chickamauga.
Of this number, there were 58,000 Union soldiers and 66,000
Confederates. During the two-day battle, there were 34,000 casualties.
Of these casualties, there were 16,000 Union; 18,000 Confederates.</p>
<p>The Union army had lost the battle of Chickamauga. Still they
had reached their objective&mdash;Chattanooga. Bragg&rsquo;s plan was to attack
the Union troops in Chattanooga on the morning of the 22nd.
However, this failed to materialize. After some light skirmishing it
was decided to call off this attack due to the Union troops being too
strongly entrenched. The Union army was still holding their line up
Lookout Mountain. Soon this line was abandoned since they realized
that Bragg would only have to place forces at any point below in order
to have control of the river line of supplies.</p>
<h3>REORGANIZATION OF THE ARMIES</h3>
<p>Both Rosecrans and Bragg immediately started a reorganization
of their armies. The Confederate army was divided into three corps,
the commands being given to Longstreet, Hardee and Breckinridge.
These three corps had a total of 10 divisions. Wheeler was in command
of the cavalry. On the Union side, McCook and Crittenden
were removed from their commands of the 20th and 21st Army
Corps. These two corps were consolidated into the 4th and Granger
was given the command. The Reserve Corps which was formerly
commanded by Granger was consolidated into the 14th Army Corps,
Maj.-Gen. John M. Palmer, commanding. The Union army at this
time had six divisions, commanded by Baird, Cruft, Davis, Johnson,
Sheridan and Wood. The Artillery Reserve was commanded by
Brannan. This latter force consisted of two divisions, each with two
brigades. Col. Parkhurst commanded the Post of Chattanooga.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="small">THE SIEGE OF CHATTANOOGA</span></h2>
<p>Bragg was determined to lay siege to the city and force the
Union army into surrendering by starvation. While the Union army
was strongly entrenching their positions in Chattanooga, the Confederates
were establishing their lines on Missionary Ridge, east of
the city, and Lookout Mountain, southwest of the city. A strong
picket line was placed along the river from Chattanooga Creek to a
point below Williams Island, including Brown&rsquo;s Ferry. Another
similar line was placed from just below the city to a point near the
mouth of the Chickamauga Creek. A skirmish line was thrown out
about one mile in front of Missionary Ridge. A short range of hills,
of which Orchard Knob was the highest, was covered by this skirmish
line. These Confederate positions controlled all supply lines
south of the river, which meant railroads, highway and the river
itself. The Union army was soon in dire straits. The only route
which was left open was to cross the river north of the city, then
cross Walden&rsquo;s Ridge or Signal Mountain; thence down the Sequatchie
Valley to Bridgeport and Stevenson. This route was about 65
miles long and most of it was mountainous roads. The fall rains
had set in and this route was almost impassable. The Union supply
wagons were easy prey for the Confederate cavalry which had been
dispatched north of the river to conduct raids. Wheeler captured
dozens of the supply wagons, killing the horses and burning the
wagons. The Union base of supplies was Nashville&mdash;160 miles distant
by very rough roads. Cattle were driven all this distance in
many instances to feed the hungry soldiers. By the time the cattle
reached Chattanooga (if they did not die enroute), they were so poor
that the Union troops often remarked that they had nothing to eat
but &ldquo;hard tack&rdquo; and &ldquo;dried beef on the hoof.&rdquo; To say the Union
soldiers were in destitute circumstances would be a mild way of expressing
their actual condition. Half rations, then quarter rations
and less. At times the soldiers only had a little raw corn to eat.
Finally it was necessary to place a sentry at the horse troughs in
order to keep the soldiers from taking the grain which was fed to a
few choice mounts. Even then, the Union army lost between 12,000
and 15,000 of their finest horses and mules from starvation. The
troops were in a starved, sickened condition, and very low in spirits.
No doubt they thought they were doomed, and that no one would
come to their rescue before they starved. However, in this surmise,
to their great joy, they were mistaken. It had been practically a
month since their defeat at Chickamauga, but let us review a little
to see what was being done to relieve this besieged army. Almost
immediately after the battle of Chickamauga, Gen. Grant started
Gen. Sherman from Vicksburg with four divisions (Army of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
Tennessee) to the assistance of Rosecrans. These re-enforcements
consisted of the 1st, 2nd and 4th divisions of the 15th Army Corps,
commanded by Brig.-Generals Peter J. Osterhaus, Morgan L. Smith
and Hugh Ewing, respectively. Also the 2nd division of the 17th
Army Corps, commanded by Brig.-Gen. John E. Smith. Thirteen
brigades were represented by Sherman&rsquo;s re-enforcements.</p>

<p class="pcap">Steamboat Being Warped Through &ldquo;The Suck&rdquo; Before the Dam
at Hale&rsquo;s Bar was built in the Tennessee</p>
</div>
<p>A detachment from the Army of the Potomac consisting of the
11th and 12th Army Corps, commanded by Maj.-Gen. Joseph Hooker,
were sent from Virginia to help lift the siege. The 11th corps was
commanded by Maj.-Gen. O. W. Howard. Howard had the 2nd and
3rd divisions, commanded by Brig.-Gen. Adolph von Steinwehr and
Maj.-Gen. Carl Schurz, respectively. The 12th corps, commanded by
Maj.-Gen. Henry W. Slocum, had the 1st and 2nd divisions, commanded
by Brig.-Generals Alpheus S. Williams and John W. Geary,
respectively. Twelve brigades were represented by Hooker&rsquo;s re-enforcements.
Hooker&rsquo;s troops left Virginia on September 25th. These
troops came by the B. and O. Railroad via Indianapolis, Louisville,
Nashville and Bridgeport. The advance of this column reached
Bridgeport September 30th. They were supposed to have helped to
reopen the Tennessee River the next day. This was impossible due
to his supply trains not being here at that time. Rosecrans had devised
a plan whereby the river supply line could be opened up. His
plan was to seize Brown&rsquo;s Ferry from Chattanooga, and bring
Hooker forward into Lookout Valley at the same time. The execution
of this plan only awaited completion of pontoon-boats for the
necessary bridge. When they were ready, Wheeler made another raid
north of the river, delaying the Union troops again. The date for the
execution of this movement was then set for October 19th. On this
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
date Rosecrans personally selected the site for throwing the bridge.
It has been reported that Rosecrans rowed a boat himself. When he
returned to his headquarters he found orders relieving him, and
placing Thomas in command. On October 23rd, Gen. Grant arrived
in Chattanooga. He approved of Rosecrans&rsquo; plan and ordered it executed
at once. Thomas at once repeated Rosecrans&rsquo; order to Hooker,
ordering him forward into Lookout Valley. Hooker&rsquo;s supply trains
reached him October 26th. He left Bridgeport on the 27th, reaching
Brown&rsquo;s Ferry the next day. In the meantime, during the night of
the 26th, a part of two Union brigades marched across Moccasin
Point, concealing themselves near Brown&rsquo;s Ferry. About 3:00 A. M.
of the 27th, there were 50 pontoon-boats placed in the Tennessee
River, each carrying 30 men. These boats floated down the river
under cover of darkness, rounding Moccasin Point unobserved by the
Confederate pickets. By a quick crossing from the north bank to
the south bank, they took the Confederates by surprise and soon
captured this position. The pontoon-boats were then leashed together,
forming a bridge across the river. At this time the troops
which had marched to this point crossed and joined the others on the
south bank.</p>

</div>
<h3>BATTLE OF WAUHATCHIE</h3>
<p>After Hooker&rsquo;s arrival in Lookout Valley during the afternoon
of the 28th, Geary&rsquo;s division stopped at Wauhatchie, four miles below
the northern point of Lookout Mountain. This was at a junction of
the Nashville and Trenton railroads. Generals Bragg and Longstreet
stood on Lookout and witnessed their arrival. About midnight Geary
was attacked by Jenkins&rsquo; division of Longstreet&rsquo;s corps. The battle
lasted until about 3:30 A. M. Geary was reinforced by two brigades
commanded by Tyndale and Orland Smith. Then the Confederates
withdrew across Lookout Creek and onto the northern slopes of Lookout
Mountain. This battle gave the Union army complete control of
all short supply lines. The Confederates never made any further
effort to regain control of this short route. The starving troops in
Chattanooga were hurriedly refitted and Grant was only awaiting
the arrival of Sherman before attacking the Confederates in their
strong positions. Meanwhile, the Confederates were still clinging to
their positions with the utmost confidence in holding them. On November
4th, Longstreet was sent to Knoxville to oppose Gen. Burnside.
His command constituted about one-third of the Confederates.
Naturally his departure shattered the Confederate hope.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>On November 18th, Sherman arrived at Trenton. He moved to
Brown&rsquo;s Ferry at once, crossing three of his divisions commanded by
M. L. Smith, Ewing and J. E. Smith.</p>
<p>Osterhaus was unable to cross his division due to the breaking of
the bridge. He was then ordered to report to Hooker, which he did
at once. From November 21st to the 23rd, Sherman was in a concealed
camp behind Stringer&rsquo;s Ridge, and near north Chickamauga
Creek. His troops floated pontoon boats down this stream into the
Tennessee River. From the north side of the river Sherman selected
a high hill on the south bank which he thought was the north end of
Missionary Ridge.</p>
<h3>GEN. GRANT&rsquo;S PLAN OF BATTLE</h3>
<p>Grant had ordered an attack against the Confederates on the 21st.
Due to bad roads, Sherman was unable to reach here by that time.
When the battle did open on the 23rd, it was not according to plan.
Under Grant&rsquo;s original plan, Hooker was to hold Lookout Valley with
Geary&rsquo;s and Cruft&rsquo;s divisions. The 11th corps was to be brought into
Chattanooga to assist either Sherman or Thomas. Sherman was to
cross the river at the mouth of the Chickamauga Creek during the
night of the 23rd, and carry Missionary Ridge as far south as the
tunnel, which at this time was not occupied by the Confederates.
When Sherman reached this position, Thomas was to move to the
left, connect with Sherman&rsquo;s right, sweep up the valley and crowd the
Confederates from their depot at Chickamauga Station, Tennessee,
their communications and positions on the ridge. The battle did not
progress as planned.</p>
<h3>CAPTURE OF ORCHARD KNOB</h3>
<p>On November 23rd, reports reached Grant&rsquo;s headquarters to the
effect that Confederates had been seen retreating from Missionary
Ridge. This was Buckner&rsquo;s Corps leaving for Knoxville to assist
Longstreet. Grant at once ordered an attack against Orchard Knob,
the outpost of the Confederates in front of Missionary Ridge.
Thomas, with five divisions, charged out against this position, soon
capturing it. The Confederate pickets moved back to the base of the
ridge. Grant then established his field headquarters at this newly
acquired point immediately, where the entire Confederate line could
be seen.</p>
<h3>BATTLE OF LOOKOUT MOUNTAIN</h3>
<p>Hooker&rsquo;s command had been assigned to Thomas who had obtained
permission for Hooker to make a demonstration against the
left of the Confederate line on Lookout Mountain. During the night
of the 23rd, Sherman crossed the Tennessee River near the present
site of the Chickamauga Dam. He reached the hill he had selected
before crossing. He made no effort to dislodge the Confederates
during the 24th. His position was not on the north end of the ridge
as he thought it to be. A deep ravine separated him from the main
north end of the ridge. From this position, the Confederates could
be seen to the south. Early on the morning of the 24th, Hooker left
Wauhatchie, moving northward to within two miles of the point of
the mountain. His troops climbed the slopes to the foot of the
palisades, made a march northward until they were near the point.
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
They were then joined by Osterhaus&rsquo; division which came directly up
the northern slopes of the mountain. They were met with a sharp
volley of fire from the Confederates as they emerged from the woods.
The Confederates had two entrenched lines running from the foot
of the cliffs to the river. They were driven out of the first line into
an open field&mdash;the Craven&rsquo;s farm. Here the fighting was desperate
and the casualties were very heavy. The Craven&rsquo;s house was used
as the Confederate headquarters. The Confederates withdrew to
their second line of entrenchments. While in this latter position the
battle ended. The sharp-shooters and the two Confederate batteries
on top were of little value during the battle. The Union soldiers
never reached the top of the mountain during the battle, nor did they
make any effort to. Therefore, there was no fighting on top of the
mountain. It was so foggy during the day that the artillerymen or
sharpshooters on the top were unable to see the troops on the slopes.
The artillery could not have been depressed sufficiently to reach the
Union troops at the foot of the cliffs&mdash;almost directly under them.
It was the troops on top that nicknamed this battle the &ldquo;Battle Above
the Clouds.&rdquo; The Confederates were outnumbered at least four to
one during this battle. They were in danger of being surrounded, so
during the night Bragg ordered the withdrawal of all troops from the
top, the slopes and Chattanooga Valley. By daylight of the 25th, all
of the Confederates were on Missionary Ridge to strengthen and prolong
their lines at that point.</p>
<p>The withdrawal of the Confederates from Lookout Mountain left
the Union forces in complete control of this point. At sunrise on the
morning of the 25th, there were volunteers from the 96th Illinois and
8th Kentucky Infantry who scaled the rock palisades and reached
the top of the mountain. They moved to the extreme northern point
where they planted their flag of victory. A series of stairways has
been erected to mark the exact route by which these Union troops
climbed out on top of the mountain.</p>
<h3>THE BATTLE OF MISSIONARY RIDGE</h3>
<p>At this time Sherman was in position to attack the right end of
the Confederate line. Thomas was in front of the center and Hooker
was opposite the left end. About 7:30 A. M., Sherman opened the
battle against the right end with heavy artillery fire. The Confederates
of Cleburne&rsquo;s, Stevenson&rsquo;s and Cheatham&rsquo;s divisions were so
strongly entrenched that he was unable to drive them from their
positions. About 10:30, Hooker was ordered forward across the
Chattanooga Valley to attack the left end. The Confederates had
destroyed the bridge across Chattanooga Creek and Hooker was delayed
at least three hours in reaching Rossville. He then moved via
Rossville Gap against the Confederate left. While these movements
were being carried out by Sherman and Hooker, Thomas was to
charge out against the Confederate rifle pits at the base of the ridge.
With this latter movement it was thought the Confederates would
be drawn toward the center from both ends, thereby giving Sherman
and Hooker more chance of success toward turning the ends. Some
of Hooker&rsquo;s troops crossed to the east side of the ridge; some moved
along the crest, and others remained on the west side of the ridge.
At 3:30 P. M., Thomas, with the troops which had carried Orchard
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
Knob on the 23rd, charged out against the Confederate rifle pits.
After a short battle, the Confederates started their retreat up the
ridge. Thomas&rsquo; men pursued without orders, both the Union and
Confederate troops reaching the crest of the ridge about the same
time. The Confederate artillery on top of the ridge was forced to
fire high since their own troops were between their artillery and the
Union forces which were following them. For at least two miles
along the central portion of the ridge, a severe hand-to-hand battle
took place. Never in the entire Civil War did troops fight any harder
than they did at this point. The casualties were heavy on both sides.
Finally, the Confederate center was broken in several places and the
center and left end started to retreat southward. At nightfall, Bragg
ordered the right of the Confederate line to withdraw and cover the
general retreat. As the Confederates were retreating, it is reported
that their own artillery was turned upon them. The Confederates
moved south via Chickamauga Station, Tennessee, thence to Ringgold,
Georgia, where they stopped to offer battle again on November
27th. They retreated to Dalton, Georgia, where they went into
winter quarters on December 1st. Gen. Bragg was removed from
his command the next day. Gen. Hardee was offered the command
but declined, although he accepted temporary charge until December
16th. At that time Gen. Joseph E. Johnston assumed command&mdash;a
position he held until July 17, 1864, when he was replaced by Gen.
John B. Hood. The Union troops moved back to Chattanooga where
they entrenched their position and went into winter quarters, thus
successfully ending the Chattanooga campaign. The city remained
in possession of the Union army until the close of the war.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>It is estimated that Grant had 60,000 troops engaged in the
battle of Chattanooga. Bragg had approximately 40,000 troops. Of
the 60,000 Union troops, Sherman had 28,000; Thomas 22,000;
Hooker 10,000. The casualties for the three-day battle were: Union,
5,824; Confederate, 6,667.</p>
<h3>ADDENDA</h3>
<p>As a reward for the Union victory at the battle of Chattanooga,
both Grant and Sherman were promoted. First, on March 9, 1864,
Grant was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant-General. On March
12, 1864, he was placed in command of all the Union forces throughout
the United States. The order which placed Grant in this latter
position was presented to him by President Lincoln. At this time
Sherman was in Nashville, Tennessee. Grant left Washington immediately
to join Sherman. Before leaving Washington, Grant had
recommended the appointment of Sherman to his late position. On
March 18, 1864, Sherman assumed command of the Military Division
of the Mississippi&mdash;Grant&rsquo;s former command. This embraced the
Departments of the Ohio, Cumberland, Tennessee and Arkansas commanded
by Major-Generals Schofield, Thomas, McPherson and Steele,
respectively. Grant left Nashville on the night of the 18th, going
east to take over his new command. He was accompanied by Sherman
as far as Cincinnati in order that they might discuss some private
details as to future plans. Sherman returned to Nashville on
March 25th. On April 28th, Sherman moved his headquarters to
Chattanooga. On May 5th, Sherman left Chattanooga on the Atlanta
Campaign. The movement of his army followed the exact route
which Highway No. 41 follows today from Chattanooga to Atlanta,
with battles and skirmishes all along the way. After the fall of Atlanta
on September 2, 1864, Sherman made final preparations for his
&ldquo;March to the Sea.&rdquo; Leaving Atlanta November 16th, his army
moved southward to Savannah, the Union forces entering this city
December 22nd. On February 1, 1865, Sherman left Savannah on
the Carolina Campaign which carried him through North and South
Carolina. He then joined Grant in Virginia, the Civil War soon came
to a close.</p>

<p>The first shot in the Civil War was fired upon the steamer &ldquo;Star of the West&rdquo;
off Charleston Harbor, S. C., on Jan. 9, 1861. However, this was more than three
months before the war officially started.</p>
<p>The Civil War started with the bombardment of Fort Sumter, S. C., at 4:30
A. M., April 12, 1861.</p>
<p>The first Southern blood was shed on the streets of Baltimore, Md., on April
19, 1861.</p>
<p>The First Confederate Congress was formed in Montgomery, Ala., on Feb.
4, 1861.</p>
<p>Jefferson Davis, of Mississippi, was elected President of the Confederacy on
Feb. 9, 1861. Alexander H. Stephens of Georgia was elected Vice-President. The
inauguration was on Feb. 18, 1861.</p>
<p>President Lincoln freed the slaves on Sept. 22, 1862.</p>
<p>The Gatling gun was patented Nov. 4, 1862.</p>
<p>The First Colored Regiment was formed Jan. 25, 1863.</p>
<p>South Carolina was the first state to secede; North Carolina was the last.
South Carolina seceded from the Union on Dec. 20, 1860. The other states followed
in this order: Florida on Jan. 7, 1861; Mississippi on Jan. 9, 1861; Alabama
on Jan. 11, 1861; Georgia on Jan. 19, 1861; Louisiana on Jan. 26, 1861; Texas on
Feb. 1, 1861; Virginia on April 17, 1861; Tennessee on May 6, 1861; Arkansas
on May 18, 1861, and North Carolina on May 21, 1861.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>There were more battles fought in Virginia than in any other state. It is
reported that more than 400 battles and actions were fought there. The second
largest number was fought in Tennessee.</p>
<p>The most eventful &ldquo;holiday&rdquo; in the Civil War was July 4, 1863. On this particular
date the Tullahoma Campaign ended; the Union army was victorious at
Gettysburg and Vicksburg fell.</p>
<p>Pickett&rsquo;s famous charge at Gettysburg was the most colorful event of the
Civil War.</p>
<p>Ohio furnished almost one-third of the Union troops at the battles of Chickamauga
and Chattanooga.</p>
<p>General Robert E. Lee was once offered the command of all the Union forces
in the United States, but he declined the offer.</p>
<p>Gen. Albert Sidney Johnston, one of the South&rsquo;s ablest commanders, resigned
the Colonelcy of the 2nd U. S. Cavalry to enter the service of the Confederacy.
Gen. Johnston was killed at the Battle of Shiloh.</p>
<p>There were approximately 87,000 men who hired their fighting done. This
number, whom were drafted, paid commutation and were exempted from service.</p>
<p>There were almost an even 100,000 of the U. S. Colored Troops whom were
recruited from the Confederate States.</p>
<p>About 250 of the Regular U. S. Volunteers were ex-Confederate soldiers.</p>
<p>All of the Confederate States had troops in the Union Army. The data below
will furnish proof of this statement:</p>
<p class="revint">Alabama&mdash;1 Regiment Heavy Artillery; 2 Regiments of Cavalry; 1 Co. of Cavalry;
2 Regiments of Infantry.</p>
<p class="revint">Arkansas&mdash;2 Batteries of Light Artillery; 4 Regiments of Cavalry; 1 Co. of Cavalry;
1 Infantry Battalion; 1 Co. of Infantry; 9 Regiments of Infantry.</p>
<p class="revint">Florida&mdash;1 Battery of Light Artillery; 3 Regiments of Cavalry; 1 Co. of Infantry.</p>
<p class="revint">Georgia&mdash;1 Infantry Battalion.</p>
<p class="revint">Louisiana&mdash;1 Regiment of Heavy Artillery; 1 Battery of Light Artillery; 4 Regiments
of Light Artillery; 1 Co. of Cavalry; 3 Regiments of Cavalry; 18
Regiments of Infantry.</p>
<p class="revint">Mississippi&mdash;2 Regiments of Heavy Artillery; 2 Regiments of Cavalry; 2 Cos. of
Cavalry; 9 Regiments of Infantry.</p>
<p class="revint">North Carolina&mdash;1 Regiment of Heavy Artillery; 7 Regiments of Infantry.</p>
<p class="revint">South Carolina&mdash;5 Regiments of Infantry (all Colored).</p>
<p class="revint">Texas&mdash;1 Battalion of Cavalry; 2 Regiments of Cavalry; 3 Cos. of Infantry.</p>
<p class="revint">Virginia&mdash;1 Battalion of Cavalry; 1 Regiment of Infantry; 1 Co. of Infantry.</p>
<p>There were four states which were considered &ldquo;divided&rdquo; states, namely:
Tennessee, Kentucky, Missouri and Maryland. Tennessee furnished more Confederate
troops than Union troops. The others furnished more Union troops than
Confederates.</p>
<p>The highest regimental number of the Civil War was furnished by the State
of Pennsylvania, being the 215th. Ohio was second with 197: New York third
with 193, while Illinois and Indiana tied for fourth place with 156 each.</p>
<p>West Point Academy was founded on March 16, 1802.</p>
<p>The U. S. Naval Academy opened October 10, 1845.</p>
<p>The Mexican War started on March 28, 1846.</p>
<p>The most daring and useless episode of the Civil War was performed by
Andrews and his raiders when they stole the engine &ldquo;General.&rdquo; This feat, if it
had been carried out in detail, would only have been temporary. The tearing up
of railroad bridges and the destruction of communication lines was almost daily
routine at one place or another. This historic engine is now on display at the
Union railroad station, Ninth and Broad Streets, Chattanooga, Tennessee.</p>
<p>The Chattanooga National Cemetery is the oldest National Cemetery in the
United States. There are soldiers buried in this cemetery as a result of every
war the United States has ever participated in, beginning with the Revolutionary
War.</p>
<p>There are no Confederate soldiers buried in any National Cemetery. They
are buried in Confederate cemeteries or elsewhere. Two such cemeteries are
located in, and near Chattanooga. One is located on E. Third Street, adjoining
the Jewish Cemetery. The other is located on U. S. Highways No. 11 and 64 at
Silverdale, about 10 miles northeast of Chattanooga.</p>
<p>Practically all of the Union and Confederate soldiers who were killed at
Chickamauga were buried on that battlefield for a period of about three months.
The troops were buried in separate trenches. Then they were removed. The
Union soldiers were re-buried in the National Cemetery in Chattanooga. The
Confederates were taken to Marietta, Georgia, where they were reburied in the
Confederate Cemetery.</p>

<p>The last battle of the Civil War was fought near Palo Alto, Texas, on May
13, 1865, more than a month after Lee&rsquo;s surrender at Appomattox. Col. Barrett
commanded the Union troops; Gen. Slaughter the Confederate. This battle resulted
in a Confederate victory.</p>
